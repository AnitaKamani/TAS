# TAS
An association for people who like to write

<br></br>
This repository was created as a back-up for the [TAS organization](https://github.com/TAS-project)

We developed a site to write stories using JS and React Framework.

I programmed the Backend. [@tarvt](https://github.com/tarvt) and [@SabaMakki](https://github.com/SabaMakki) were the Frontend programmers.
